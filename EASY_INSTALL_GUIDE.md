# How to Get the App File (APK) Without Installing Flutter

Since you cannot run the build commands locally (and the local `ios` and `android` folders are currently empty), we will use **GitHub Actions** to build the app for you in the cloud.

> **Why are the folders empty?**
> The native files (for Xcode/Android Studio) are usually generated by the Flutter tool. Since Flutter isn't installed here, I couldn't generate them. **However, I have configured GitHub to generate them automatically for you.**

## Step 1: Upload to GitHub (Get the Android/Huawei App)

1.  **Create a GitHub Account** (if you don't have one) at [github.com](https://github.com).
2.  **Create a New Repository**:
    *   Name it `partsfather-mobile`.
    *   Make it **Public** or **Private**.
3.  **Upload Files**:
    *   Upload all the files in this `mobile_app` folder to that repository.
    *   (Or use Git: `git init`, `git add .`, `git commit -m "Initial commit"`, `git push...`)

## Step 2: Download the App

Once you upload the code, GitHub will automatically see the special file I created (`.github/workflows/build_apk.yml`) and start building your app.

1.  Go to your repository on GitHub.
2.  Click the **Actions** tab at the top.
3.  You will see a workflow running named **Build Android App**.
4.  Wait for it to turn green (Success).
5.  Click on the workflow run.
6.  Scroll down to the **Artifacts** section.
7.  Click **app-release** to download the ZIP file.
8.  Unzip it to find `app-release.apk`.

**This APK works on Android and Huawei devices.**

## What about iPhone (iOS)?

**Apple does not allow downloading app files directly** (like `.ipa`) without using the App Store or TestFlight.

**The Solution: Use the Web Version**
Since you want to "share it immediately" with an iPhone:
1.  Upload the `web` folder (or use the GitHub repository) to **Vercel** or **Cloudflare Pages**.
2.  It will give you a website link (e.g., `partsfather.vercel.app`).
3.  Open that link on your iPhone Safari.
4.  Tap **Share** -> **Add to Home Screen**.
5.  It will look and feel exactly like an app.

## How to Fix the Empty Folders Locally?

If you want to work on this code on your own computer:
1.  Install [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev).
2.  Open the project folder.
3.  Double-click the `REPAIR_PROJECT.bat` file I created.
4.  It will magically fill the `ios` and `android` folders with the correct files!
